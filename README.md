Hyperframes is an open-source video rendering framework that lets you create, preview, and render HTML-based video compositions — with first-class support for AI agents.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: With an AI coding agent (recommended)

Install the HyperFrames skills, then describe the video you want:

```bash
npx skills add heygen-com/hyperframes
```

This teaches your agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Codex) how to write correct compositions, GSAP timelines, Tailwind v4 browser-runtime styles, and first-party adapter animations. In Claude Code, the skills register as slash commands — invoke `/hyperframes` to author compositions, `/hyperframes-cli` for the dev-loop commands (init, lint, preview, render), `/hyperframes-media` for asset preprocessing (TTS, transcription, background removal), `/tailwind` for `init --tailwind` projects, `/gsap` for timeline animation help, or the adapter skills (`/animejs`, `/css-animations`, `/lottie`, `/three`, `/waapi`) when a composition uses those runtimes.

For Claude Design, open [`docs/guides/claude-design-hyperframes.md`](https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes/blob/main/docs/guides/claude-design-hyperframes.md) on GitHub and click the download button (↓) to save it, then attach the file to your Claude Design chat. It produces a valid first draft; refine in any AI coding agent. See the [Claude Design guide](https://hyperframes.heygen.com/guides/claude-design).

For Codex specifically, the same skills are also exposed as an [OpenAI Codex plugin](./.codex-plugin/plugin.json) — sparse-install just the plugin surface:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add heygen-com/hyperframes --sparse .codex-plugin --sparse skills --sparse assets
```

For Claude Code, the repo also ships a [Claude Code plugin manifest](./.claude-plugin/plugin.json): test it locally with `claude --plugin-dir .`. The manifest intentionally omits `skills` because Claude Code auto-discovers the root `skills/` directory by convention, and for marketplace submission use the title `HyperFrames by HeyGen` plus the black/white icon assets at [`assets/claude-code-icon-dark.svg`](./assets/claude-code-icon-dark.svg) and [`assets/claude-code-icon-light.svg`](./assets/claude-code-icon-light.svg) for the two theme slots.
For Cursor, the same skills are packaged as a [Cursor plugin](./.cursor-plugin/plugin.json) — install from the Cursor Marketplace, or sideload by cloning this repo and pointing **Settings → Plugins → Load unpacked** at the repo root.

#### Try it: example prompts

Copy any of these into your agent to get started. The `/hyperframes` prefix loads the skill context explicitly so you get correct output the first time.

**Cold start — describe what you want:**

> Using `/hyperframes`, create a 10-second product intro with a fade-in title, a background video, and background music.

**Warm start — turn existing context into a video:**

> Take a look at this GitHub repo https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes and explain its uses and architecture to me using `/hyperframes`.

> Summarize the attached PDF into a 45-second pitch video using `/hyperframes`.

> Turn this CSV into an animated bar chart race using `/hyperframes`.

**Format-specific:**

> Make a 9:16 TikTok-style hook video about [topic] using `/hyperframes`, with bouncy captions synced to a TTS narration.

**Iterate — talk to the agent like a video editor:**

> Make the title 2x bigger, swap to dark mode, and add a fade-out at the end.

> Add a lower third at 0:03 with my name and title.

The agent handles scaffolding, animation, and rendering. See the [prompting guide](https://hyperframes.heygen.com/guides/prompting) for more patterns.

### Option 2: Start a project manually

```bash
npx hyperframes init my-video
cd my-video
npx hyperframes preview      # preview in browser (live reload)
npx hyperframes render       # render to MP4
```

`hyperframes init` installs skills automatically, so you can hand off to your AI agent at any point.

**Requirements:** Node.js >= 22, FFmpeg

## Why Hyperframes?

- **HTML-native** — compositions are HTML files with data attributes. No React, no proprietary DSL.
- **AI-first** — agents already speak HTML. The CLI is non-interactive by default, designed for agent-driven workflows.
- **Deterministic rendering** — same input = identical output. Built for automated pipelines.
- **Frame Adapter pattern** — bring your own animation runtime (GSAP, Lottie, CSS, Three.js).

## Hyperframes vs Remotion

Hyperframes is inspired by [Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev) — we used Remotion at HeyGen in production, learned a ton from it, and kept attribution comments in the source for the patterns it pioneered (Chrome launch flags, image2pipe → FFmpeg streaming, frame buffering). Both tools drive headless Chrome and both are deterministic. They differ on one decision: **what the primary author writes.** Remotion's bet is React components; Hyperframes' bet is HTML.

| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Authoring                                             | HTML + CSS + GSAP              | React components (TSX)            |
| Build step                                            | None; `index.html` plays as-is | Required (bundler)                |
| Library-clock animations (GSAP, Anime.js, Motion One) | Seekable, frame-accurate       | Plays at wall-clock during render |
| Arbitrary HTML / CSS passthrough                      | Paste and animate              | Rewrite as JSX                    |
| Distributed rendering                                 | Single-machine today           | Lambda, production-ready          |

### Licensing: fully open source vs source-available

**Hyperframes is completely open source under [Apache 2.0](LICENSE)** — an OSI-approved license. Use it commercially at any scale, with no per-render fees, no seat caps, no company-size thresholds.

**Remotion is [source-available, not open source](https://www.remotion.pro/license).** The code is on GitHub under a custom Remotion License that requires a paid company license above small-team thresholds. It's a great product with a real team behind it — but if open-source licensing matters to you (OSI compliance, redistribution rights, no per-use fees), that's a first-order decision point.

## How It Works

Define your video as HTML with data attributes:

```html
<div id="stage" data-composition-id="my-video" data-start="0" data-width="1920" data-height="1080">
  <video
    id="clip-1"
    data-start="0"
    data-duration="5"
    data-track-index="0"
    src="intro.mp4"
    muted
    playsinline
  ></video>
  <img
    id="overlay"
    class="clip"
    data-start="2"
    data-duration="3"
    data-track-index="1"
    src="logo.png"
  />
  <audio
    id="bg-music"
    data-start="0"
    data-duration="9"
    data-track-index="2"
    data-volume="0.5"
    src="music.wav"
  ></audio>
</div>
```

Preview instantly in the browser. Render to MP4 locally or in Docker.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

### Cloning the repo

The repo uses [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com) for golden regression-test baselines under `packages/producer/tests/**/output.mp4` (~240 MB of `.mp4` files). If you're cloning the full repo for development, install Git LFS first:

```bash
# macOS
brew install git-lfs

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install git-lfs

# Windows
winget install GitHub.GitLFS
# (or install Git for Windows, which bundles Git LFS as an optional component)

# Then (once, per machine)
git lfs install
```

If you hit `git-lfs filter-process: command not found` during `git clone` or `npx skills add heygen-com/hyperframes`, install Git LFS and retry. You can also skip LFS content if you only need the source files:

```bash
GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 git clone https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes.git
```
