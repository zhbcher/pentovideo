# Pentovideo

Open-source video rendering framework: write HTML, render video.

```
packages/
  cli/       → pentovideo CLI (create, preview, lint, render)
  core/      → Types, parsers, generators, linter, runtime, frame adapters
  engine/    → Seekable page-to-video capture engine (Puppeteer + FFmpeg)
  player/    → Embeddable <pentovideo-player> web component
  producer/  → Full rendering pipeline (capture + encode + audio mix)
  studio/    → Browser-based composition editor UI
```

## Development

```bash
bun install     # Install dependencies
bun run build   # Build all packages
bun run test    # Run tests
```

**This repo uses bun**, not pnpm. Do NOT run `pnpm install` — it creates a `pnpm-lock.yaml` that should not exist. Workspace linking relies on bun's resolution from `"workspaces"` in root `package.json`.

### Linting & Formatting

This project uses **oxlint** and **oxfmt** (not biome, not eslint, not prettier).

```bash
bunx oxlint <files>        # Lint
bunx oxfmt <files>         # Format (write)
bunx oxfmt --check <files> # Format (check only, used by pre-commit hook)
```

Always run both on changed files before committing. The lefthook pre-commit hook runs `bunx oxlint` and `bunx oxfmt --check` automatically.

### Adding CLI Commands

When adding a new CLI command:

1. Define the command in `packages/cli/src/commands/<name>.ts` using `defineCommand` from citty
2. **Export `examples`** in the same file — `export const examples: Example[] = [...]` (import `Example` from `./_examples.js`). These are displayed by `--help`.
3. Register it in `packages/cli/src/cli.ts` under `subCommands` (lazy-loaded)
4. **Add to help groups** in `packages/cli/src/help.ts` — add the command name and description to the appropriate `GROUPS` entry. Without this, the command won't appear in `pentovideo --help` even though it works.
5. **Document it** in `docs/packages/cli.mdx` — add a section with usage examples and flags.
6. Validate by running `npx tsx packages/cli/src/cli.ts --help` (command appears in the list) and `npx tsx packages/cli/src/cli.ts <name> --help` (examples appear).

### Regression Test Golden Baselines (producer)

`packages/producer/tests/<name>/output/output.mp4` baselines MUST be generated
inside `Dockerfile.test`, not on your host. CI renders inside that Docker image
with a specific Chrome + ffmpeg build; pixel-level output drifts across
different host Chrome/ffmpeg versions and will fail PSNR at dozens of
checkpoints even when the code is correct.

```bash
# Build the test image once:
docker build -t pentovideo-producer:test -f Dockerfile.test .

# Generate or update a baseline (runs the harness with --update inside Docker):
bun run --cwd packages/producer docker:test:update <test-name>
```

Never run `bun run --cwd packages/producer test:update` directly from the
host to capture a baseline that will be committed — the resulting output.mp4
will not match CI. Use it only for local-only experimentation.

## Skills

Composition authoring (not repo development) is guided by skills installed via `npx skills add heygen-com/pentovideo`. See `skills/` for source. Invoke `/pentovideo`, `/pentovideo-cli`, `/pentovideo-registry`, `/tailwind`, or `/gsap` when authoring compositions. Use `/tailwind` for projects created with `pentovideo init --tailwind` so agents follow the pinned Tailwind v4 browser-runtime contract instead of Studio's Tailwind v3 setup. Use `/animejs`, `/css-animations`, `/lottie`, `/three`, or `/waapi` when a composition uses those first-party runtime adapters. Invoke `/pentovideo-media` for asset preprocessing (TTS narration, audio/video transcription, background removal for transparent overlays) — these commands have their own skill so the CLI skill stays focused on the dev loop. When a user provides a website URL and wants a video, invoke `/website-to-pentovideo` — it runs the full 7-step capture-to-video pipeline.
